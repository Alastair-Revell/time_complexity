# Introduction to Time-Complexity of Sorting Algorithms #

## Bubble Sort ##

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping adjacent pairs of values until a list is sorted.

On average, the bubble sort has a complexity of <img src="/tex/7b25d69bfeac6146b87105e365c75c90.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=19.547970749999987pt height=26.76175259999998pt/>
